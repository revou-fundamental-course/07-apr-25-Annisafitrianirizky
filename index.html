          <h3>EXO</h3>
          <p class="artist-description">EXO represents one of our most successful and influential groups to date. Debuting in 2012 with a unique dual-unit concept (EXO-K and EXO-M), EXO was designed to simultaneously target the Korean and Chinese markets‚Äîa groundbreaking strategy at the time. Their exceptional talent, versatility in music genres, and strong group identity have led to numerous record-breaking achievements, both domestically and internationally. EXO has significantly contributed to the global spread of K-pop and has set new standards in performance, branding, and fan engagement. We view EXO not just as artists, but as a cornerstone of SM‚Äôs legacy.</p>
